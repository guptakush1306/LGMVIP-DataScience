PROJECT TITLE : Iris Species Classification

GOAL : To Predict the species of the iris flower.

DATASET :http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris

Work that has been done :firstly we import the dataset and did some data analysis and made certain graphs and plots and trianed and tested the data and then applied machine learning algorithms like knn,ada boost classification and models of ensemble learnings
SO by the algorithms we get accuracy upto 100%.
LIBRARIES:

PANDAS

NUMPY

MATPLOTLIB

SEABORN

SCIPY

SKLEARN

Conclusion : We got a good accuracy score of about 99 % using Random Forest Classifier and Ada Boost Classifier
